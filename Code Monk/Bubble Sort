# Bubble Sort

Pseudo Code :
void bubble_sort( int A[], int n ) {
    int temp;
    for(int k = 0; k< n-1; k++) {
        // (n-k-1) is for ignoring comparisons of elements which have already been compared in earlier iterations.
        for(int i = 0; i <n-k-1; i++) {
            if(A[ i ] > A[ i+1] ) {
                // here swapping of positions is being done.
                temp = A[ i ];
                A[ i ] = A[ i+1 ];
                A[ i + 1] = temp;
            }
        }
    }
}

Time Complexity : 
Worst Case : O(n^2)
Best Case : O(n)
Average case performance : O(nÂ²)
Worst case space complexity O(n) total, O(1) auxiliary, as the only extra memory it requires is that of the temporary value created when swapping adjacent elements.
Optimal : No
